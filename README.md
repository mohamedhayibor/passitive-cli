# passitive-cli
Custom password management system for your personal use.

![](http://g.recordit.co/WUgip0vkkn.gif)

This tool first ecrypts then saves it into your local computer. When you want the password back, enter: `pass <account>` then the password gets decrypted and put into your clipboard for 8 seconds.

## Usage

Examples queries:
```sh
  > pass <account> <password>
  > pass <account>       (puts decrypted password into your clipboard)
  > pass <path> -j       (to ecrypt all password from a json file)
  > pass -c              (to delete all accounts and passwords)
  > pass <account> -d    (to delete that account and password)
  > pass -p              (to get the path where your encrypted passwords are)
```

## Installation

Go to whatever directory you want to install it on.

```sh
> git clone https://github.com/mohamedhayibor/passitive-cli.git
> npm link
```
> npm link allows you run the command anywhere.

> Use sudo at the beginning if you are getting permissions issues. Both ways will allow you to run the command anywhere.

## Set up (important)
If you are using bash, your default set up will record every command you pass to the terminal and you certainly don't want that in this case. [Disable the recording](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18663078/disable-history-in-linux).

For your Master key:

1. create .env file
2. then edit it like so:
```
MASTER_KEY="whatever master key, preferably long, annoying to read and personal"
```
Feel free to hack it to your own needs.

If your Master key is not loading properly, set up the .env [config param](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#path).

### Raison D'etre
Managing passwords is already super hard. But there is a constant dilemma between `ease of use` and security. The advantage is that using a custom encryption/decryption is much more secure than using popular password mangament tools as they attract more attention.
